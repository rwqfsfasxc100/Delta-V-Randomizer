# Delta-V-Randomizer
A mod that completely randomizes ships and/or equipment fitted on the loading of the vessel.



### Options
This mod has several options to allow for a filtered experience.

#### Randomize ships
* Causes all ships to choose a random model.
* Disabling this will end allow only equipment randomization for vessels
* May not function correctly if randomize equipment is disabled

#### Randomize equipment
* Selects random equipment for all slots for the ship. Uses only equipment valid for the slot.
* By default, only uses equipment available for the slot

#### Allow unobtainable ships
* Adds ships normally unobtainable to player, yet registered as valid ships by the game, to the random ship pool.
* Allows for the Hybrid, Obonto Habitat, MAD CERF, Racing Drone, Atlas, and Tsukuyomi to the random ship pool
* This likely may cause issues and/or crashes with respective vessels. (i.e. Obonto Habitat will crash the game if the ER-42 is installed at the same time)

#### Remove equipment restriction
* Removes usual slot restrictions. Equipment from a slot type will always be available from the random pool.
* Any orientation of equipment can be fitted to a slot, not just the correct side.
* Do expect this to cause severe issues. There is nothing to prevent equipment clipping into the ship and making it unflyable.

#### Override consumable limits
* Lets any numerical equipment be available. This is a toned-down equivalent to remove equipment restrictions.
* Does not do anything unique if remove equipment restriction is enabled
* Removes ship limits for the turbine, reactor core, ultracapacitor, propellant tank, driver magazine and nano storage.
